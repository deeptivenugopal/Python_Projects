***SCRAPE AUTHORS QUOTES***

This is a simple project to extract quotes and authors names from website - https://quotes.toscrape.com/. It was initially built as a very simple single python file to scrape quotes
with requests, BeautifulSoup libraries. It was extended to handle Exceptions, logging at every step and write to a file. Later I got an idea to make this as API project using FastAPI.
