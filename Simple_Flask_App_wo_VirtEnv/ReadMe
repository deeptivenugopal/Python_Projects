Important Point:

In every article or video, to create a Flask app it was required to create a Virtual Environment first. However, a VE is not specific to Flask projects this can be essential for projects which deal with multiple versions of Python libraries and to maintain the compatibility.

So just to check if Flask runs without virtual env, I created a simple project with few lines and installed Flask
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
	return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()
